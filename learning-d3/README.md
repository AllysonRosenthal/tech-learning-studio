# Learning D3

## Week 1
Things I did:
1. Cloned the [textbook repo](https://github.com/AllysonRosenthal/d3-book)
2. Chapter 4: Setup
  * Download D3
  * Create index.html
  * ~Set up a local server using Python~

### In Class
I spent today trying to get off the ground with D3. There's a pretty big chunk of assumed knowledge around web programming (which Murray warns about in the first chapter of his book). I thought I'd be in good shape, since I have a solid grasp of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work. 

It turns out that there are quite a few things that didn't come with warnings, since Murray assumes you either are already comfortable with certain tools (Git, in this instance) or will avoid them. I'm actually in a middle ground, where I am *familiar* with Git, but not quite *comfortable* with it. Luckily, all of my simple questions have been asked before, and I was able to find the answers via Stack Overflow and the GitHub help documentation. So, I was able to get the bulk of the first project set up, but more slowly than I would have liked.
