# Learning D3

## Week 1
Things I did:
1. Cloned the [textbook repo](https://github.com/AllysonRosenthal/d3-book)
2. Chapter 4: Setup
  * Download D3
  * Create index.html
  * ~Set up a local server using Python~

### In Class
I spent today trying to get off the ground with D3. There's a pretty big chunk of assumed knowledge around web programming (which Murray warns about in the first chapter of his book). I thought I'd be in good shape, since I have a solid grasp of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work. 

It turns out that there are quite a few things that didn't come with warnings, since Murray assumes you either are already comfortable with certain tools (Git, in this instance) or will avoid them. I'm actually in a middle ground, where I am *familiar* with Git, but not quite *comfortable* with it. Luckily, all of my simple questions have been asked before, and I was able to find the answers via Stack Overflow and the GitHub help documentation. So, I was able to get the bulk of the first project set up, but more slowly than I would have liked. 

I also ran into a problem with the command line developer tools, which I had to install for inscrutable reasons. I've used Git from the command line with no problems before, so I'm slightly baffled by that one. Again, this hiccup was easily overcome, but waiting for the download and installation slowed me down.

### Outside of Class
I'm going to be sure to get the setup finished, so I can spend my time in class next week actually working through the textbook and examples. I'm also going to investigate how to share the project through bl.ocks.org, since it looks like that isn't covered in the textbook that I've chosen, but would be my preferred method for turning in this project.
