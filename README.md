# Technology Learning Studio
For the Fall 2017 semester, I'm enrolled in Dr. Howison's Technology Learning Studio in the [School of Information](https://www.ischool.utexas.edu/) at the University of Texas. 

I'll keep track of three learning projects in this repo. Two of those projects will focus on learning to use D3 with Scott Murray's *[Interactive Data Visualization for the Web](http://alignedleft.com/work/d3-book-2e)*. The third will be learning to crochet through a [sampler scarf](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/wonderland-sampler-scarf).

# Learning D3
D3, or data-driven documents, is a JavaScript library for creating highly customizable visualizations.

### Goals
**Simple** - Complete the second [D3 Makeover](http://tinyletter.com/curran/letters/introducing-d3-makeover) challenge by remaking [this visualization](http://tinyletter.com/curran/letters/d3-makeover-ii) using D3 and submit it with the #d3Makeover hastag on Twitter.

**Stretch** - Apply my new D3 knowledge to a problem out in the wild. The Data for Democracy [hackathon](https://www.meetup.com/Data-for-Democracy-Austin/events/243063332/) is right at the end of the first unit, so I'll attend and see where I can jump in.

# Using D3 with Geospatial Data
I'm using D3 as a way to explore mapping and geospatial data.

### Goals
**Simple** - Complete the first [D3 Makeover](http://tinyletter.com/curran/letters/introducing-d3-makeover) challenge by remaking [this map](http://one.laptop.org/map) using D3

**Stretch** - Make the map interactive.
