# Technology Learning Studio
For the Fall 2017 semester, I'm enrolled in Dr. Howison's Technology Learning Studio in the [School of Information](https://www.ischool.utexas.edu/) at the University of Texas. 

I'll keep track of three learning projects in this repo. Two of those projects will focus on learning to use D3 with Scott Murray's *[Interactive Data Visualization for the Web](http://alignedleft.com/work/d3-book-2e)*. The third will be learning to crochet through a [sampler scarf](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/wonderland-sampler-scarf).

## Learning Crochet
There's a third project for this course that focuses on a physical technology, for which I've chosen crochet. That project is available on [Ravelry](http://www.ravelry.com/projects/allyro/wonderland-sampler-scarf).
