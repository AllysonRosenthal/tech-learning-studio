# Learning Open Source

## Week 1
I spent today reading through guides on gettings started contributing to open source projects. I learned that most projects that are set up for new contributors have a file called CONTRIBUTING, which has guidelines for how you can get involved and the project lead's required format for pull requests. 

I also went through the lists of open source projects that are beginner friendly, and found a few that look like a good fit. For my first pull request, I'm going to contribute to [one of these lists](https://github.com/vredniy/awesome-awesomeness). All you need to contribute is a link that isn't already on one of the lists and the knowledge to create a pull request, which has clear guidelines in their CONTRIBUTING file. So, this first pull request can be all about following the steps to make a pull request, and future pull requests can then move into how to follow guidelines for code. It does look like I could contribute to more than one list after browsing through them during class, but I'd like to shoot for more substantial pull requests for the other three that I need to complete Hacktoberfest.

Another project that I identified is [yoda](https://github.com/yoda-pa/yoda), a personal assistant that lives in the command line. I think this is a good candidate for three reasons: 
 1. It's written in Python, which I'm already familiar with.
 2. It sounds like something I'd use, which is the conventional wisdom on the best projects to contribute to. 
 3. It's set up so that you can contribute a single "skill," or feature, which will let me make a self-contained pull request.

After reading through a bunch of CONTRIBUTING documentation, I feel like I have a much better handle on what's generally expected. I also feel a little like an idiot for not knowing those existed, but I'm a lot more comfortable now that I know that those signal projects that are receptive to contributions. It's a little intimidating to make a pull request that no one has asked for (which was not the case with the open source project that I'm working on with Open Austin, which is made up of people that I've met in real life). Now that I know I can look for CONTRIBUTING docs, I feel like I've started to get my feet under me on how open source works and how to best make a pull request that will be welcomed.

## Week 2
I'm trying to contribute this line to the [awesome-newsletters](https://github.com/vredniy/awesome-newsletters) list:
 * [Best in Visual Storytelling](http://tinyletter.us16.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=5c12dabe1e59a9fbde1174b8c&id=e27a48af53). Monday roundup of the best in data journalism from the past week. Paid version also includes data visualization job postings.

I promptly broke everything.
 * made a clone and a branch without forking first
 * did not realize that was a thing until I made my commit and was trying to figure out how to push it to someone else's repo
 * there are lots of things telling you how to do something correctly, but none telling you how to fix something you broke (or they're way harder to find)
 * if you try to burn everything to the ground and start over by deleting the directory, git will follow you straight into the trash
 * googling "unfuck git" [actually works](http://ohshitgit.com/)
 * added bonus of choosing a really easy contribution for my first PR: I could stick my one-line contribution here temporarily, and it's no big deal to add back to the file. So, I now know what NOT to do ever again, without a huge loss of work.
